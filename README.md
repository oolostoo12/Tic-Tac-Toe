# Tic-Tac-Toe
==============
Here is one of my first projects I've done by myself. Its a simple tic-tac-toe game. I would like to make a GUI for it to make it look 
nice. If any collaborators have any ideas to how this can be made possible, please don't hesitate in commenting. No code is neccesary, links to tips on how to use Java's GUI or even books would be great!
